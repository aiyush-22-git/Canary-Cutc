Authenticated release-evidence dashboard for the **Cyber Red Team Foundry** backend, built with React 19 + TypeScript + Vite 8. CI owns attack execution; the browser never holds a Canary bearer token.

The Vercel deployment uses a server-side GitHub OAuth session. The `/api/*`
proxy requires that session before forwarding requests to Canary and injects the
server-only backend credential. GitHub OAuth access tokens are exchanged and
discarded server-side; only a signed, short-lived HttpOnly session cookie is
sent to the browser.

## Pages

### RunAuditPage — `/audit`

Historical campaign monitoring. Production attack launches happen in GitHub Actions.

- Submits `POST /api/campaigns/run` with target URL, attack strategies, and intensity.
- Opens SSE stream for live events; renders 4-node agent topology with animated edges.
- Three phases: **CONFIG → RUNNING → REPORT**.
- Final report: campaign_id, run_id, finding counts (by severity), duration, target.
- The public deployment does not simulate results when API access is unavailable.

**SSE event types** emitted by `POST /api/campaigns/run`:

| Event | Payload summary |
|---|---|
| `agent_state` | Agent name + current state (idle, active, complete) — drives topology animation |
| `log` | Free-text log line from any agent |
| `finding` | Structured finding: id, severity, title, description |
| `campaign_complete` | Terminal event: campaign_id, run_id, summary counts, duration |

### FindingsPage — `/findings`

Paginated findings review with status management.

- Filters by `severity`, `status`, `asi_class`.
- Verdict badges lazy-fetch details and render confidence score + verdict path.
- Status transitions (`PUT /api/findings/{id}/status`) require `reviewer_id` + `rationale`.
- Attempts table from `GET /api/findings/{id}/attempts`.

### RedTeamPage — `/redteam`

Live incident feed and run detail panel.

- Polls `GET /api/incidents` every 30 seconds.
- Row click opens detail panel from `GET /api/runs/{run_id}`.
- Attacks table with humanized strategy labels and finding IDs (linkable to FindingsPage).

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Framework | React 19 + TypeScript |
| Bundler | Vite 8 |
| Styling | TailwindCSS 3 |
| Typography | JetBrains Mono |
| Linting | Oxlint |
| Production server | nginx 1.25-alpine |

No external UI component library. All UI is hand-built with Tailwind utility classes.

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `CANARY_API_URL` | Upstream backend base URL, server-side Vercel env | — |
| `CANARY_API_TOKEN` | Scoped backend bearer token, server-side Vercel env | — |
| `GITHUB_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` | GitHub OAuth App client ID, server-side | — |
| `GITHUB_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET` | GitHub OAuth App secret, server-side | — |
| `GITHUB_OAUTH_REDIRECT_URI` | OAuth callback URL (`/api/auth/callback`) | Derived from `APP_URL` |
| `GITHUB_ALLOWED_LOGINS` | Comma-separated GitHub logins allowed into the dashboard | Required; fail closed |
| `SESSION_SECRET` | At least 32 random characters for signing sessions | — |
| `APP_URL` | Canonical Vercel dashboard URL | Request origin |
| `AUTH_REQUIRED` | Keep `true` in deployments; `false` enables bypass only in non-production or when the explicit development flag is set | `true` |
| `CANARY_DEV_BYPASS` | Set to `true` only for the temporary hosted hackathon development bypass; never use for a public production deployment | `false` |

The browser always requests its same-origin `/api/*` path. Vercel's authenticated proxy injects the server-side token and forwards typed dashboard management requests; Docker nginx injects `API_SECRET_KEY` into its upstream request.

No `VITE_API_TOKEN` is supported: Vite would embed it in a public JavaScript bundle.

---

## nginx SSE Configuration

The production nginx config applies the following settings on the `/api/campaigns/run` SSE route so events are not buffered:

```
proxy_buffering off;
proxy_cache off;
proxy_read_timeout 300s;
add_header X-Accel-Buffering no;
```

Without these, nginx's default response buffering will hold SSE frames until the buffer fills, breaking the live topology animation and log stream.

---

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev        # http://localhost:5173
```

For local UI work, run the Docker stack so nginx can supply the server-side API credential. The Vite server is intentionally not an authenticated production proxy.

---

## Production Build

```bash
npm run build      # outputs to dist/
```

Type-checking (`tsc -b`) runs before bundling. Fix all type errors before deploying.

---

## Docker

Multi-stage build: Node 20 builds the static assets, nginx 1.25-alpine serves them.

```bash
docker build -t canary-frontend \
  .
```

Or bring up the full stack from the repo root:

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

The container serves the SPA on port **8000** and proxies `/api/*` to `redteam-backend:8001`.

---

## Scripts

| Script | Command | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `dev` | `vite` | Dev server with HMR |
| `build` | `tsc -b && vite build` | Type-check + bundle |
| `lint` | `oxlint` | Static analysis |
| `preview` | `vite preview` | Preview production build locally |

---

## API Surface

The dashboard proxy authenticates the GitHub session server-side and forwards
the browser's typed API calls. It supports read and dashboard-management
methods, while CI continues to use a separate scoped project token directly
against the backend. Every browser request is wrapped in `src/lib/api.ts`.

Configure the GitHub OAuth App callback as:

```
https://<your-vercel-domain>/api/auth/callback
```

For the separate hackathon dashboard, use
`https://canary-cutc-2026-dashboard.vercel.app/api/auth/callback` (or the
custom Vercel domain assigned to that project). In the Vercel project, add the
following as server-side environment variables for the Production and Preview
environments: `GITHUB_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`, `GITHUB_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET`,
`GITHUB_OAUTH_REDIRECT_URI`, `GITHUB_ALLOWED_LOGINS`, `SESSION_SECRET`, and
`APP_URL`. `GITHUB_ALLOWED_LOGINS` is a comma-separated allowlist of GitHub
login names; an empty allowlist intentionally fails closed. The OAuth client
secret and session secret are never exposed to browser code.

For local development, set `AUTH_REQUIRED=false`. The hosted hackathon demo
also uses `AUTH_REQUIRED=false` plus `CANARY_DEV_BYPASS=true` explicitly; this
returns a local development identity and must be removed before public
production. Production should use `AUTH_REQUIRED=true` (the default) with the
GitHub credentials and allowlist configured above.

Keep `CANARY_API_TOKEN`, `GITHUB_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET`, and `SESSION_SECRET` in
Vercel server-side environment variables only. Never prefix them with `VITE_`.
